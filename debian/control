Description: Plugins for nagios compatible monitoring systems
 This package provides various plugins for Nagios compatible monitoring
 systems like Nagios and Icinga.
 It contains the following plugins:
 .
   * check_ajp (1): plugin to monitor the AJP ping response time
     Should work with all application servers (Tomcat, JBoss,....)
     which provide an AJPv13 connector.
   * check_backuppc (1.1.0): plugin for checking on the status of
     BackupPC backups
   * check_checksums (20130611): plugin to verify file checksums
     against (local, not 100% secure) lists.
     Supports md5 sha1 sha224 sha256 sha384 sha512 checksums.
   * check_clamav (1.2): plugin to check for clamav signature freshness
     This script is used to compare the version and signature
     level of the currently running clamd daemon with the latest
     available versions listed in the TXT record for
     current.cvd.clamav.net.
   * check_cups (0.2): plugin to check queues on a remote CUPS server
     This plugin is monitoring of queues on a remote CUPS server,
     which means that it doesn't need to be installed on the print
     server and run via NRPE.
   * check_email_delivery (0.7.1b): plugin to monitor email delivery
     Some typical uses of this plugin include:
       - check SMTP server
       - check messages and quota on IMAP server
       - check email delivery loop
       - check auto-responder function
       - keep an eye on email lag
       - monitor automated mailboxes
       - check email-to-FTP or other special email gateways
   * check_graphite: Plugin to monitor graphite metrics
   * check_haproxy (rev135): plugin check the HAProxy statistics url
   * check_hpasm (4.6.3.2): plugin to check the hardware health of
     HP Proliant Servers
     It either uses snmp or - if installed - the hpasm package locally.
     The plugin checks the health of
       * Processors
       * Power supplies
       * Memory modules
       * Fans
       * CPU- and board-temperatures
       * Raids
     and alerts you if one of these components is faulty or operates
     outside its normal parameters.
   * check_httpd_status (rev140): plugin checking Apache or Lighthttpd
     server-status page (using mod_status)
   * check_ipmi_sensor (3.1): IPMI Sensor Monitoring Plugin
     Plugin to monitor the hardware status (fan speed, temperaturs,
     voltages, power usage, ...) of a server using IPMI.
   * check_libs (520): plugin to report the usage of no longer existing
     libraries by running processes
   * check_lm_sensors (3.1.1): plugin to monitor hardware sensors
     and disk temperatures
   * check_memcached (1.3): plugin to check memcached instances
     It will give a critical message if a partiular memcached host is
     inaccessible and generate a warning if the hit/miss ratio falls
     below a given threshold or the number of evictions exceeds a given
     limit.
     Hit/miss and evictions are measured over a 30 minute interval,
     using a memcached object to store the earlier statistics.
   * check_memory (1.0): plugin to check for free memory
     This plugin excludes the system cache and buffer, because
     on some system with very stable memory usage it is perfectly
     normal for system cache to fill in all available memory.
   * check_multipath (0.1.9): plugin to monitor the number of available and
     failed paths of multipath devices
   * check_mysql_health (2.1.8.2): plugin to check various parameters of a
     MySQL database
   * check_nfsmounts: checks whether there are stale NFS mounts on the host
   * check_printer: plugin to check printer supply levels using SNMP
     It outputs performance data for all supplies
     found, for example toner and drum.
   * check_raid (3.0.1+ba57f5f): plugin to check sw/hw RAID status
     The plugin looks for any known types of RAID configurations,
     and checks them all.
     .

     information from Cisco, Nokia, Blue Coat, IronPort,
     Foundry Network, Linux (using lm-sensors), Extreme Networks,
     Juniper Networks, HP ProCurve, Netscreen, Citrix NetScaler

     (JSP, ASP, CGI, PHP, AJAX, Servlets, HTML Forms,
     XML/SOAP Web Services, REST, etc).
   * check_whois (1.14): plugin to check for the expiration of a domain.
     The plugin may not yet work with all registrars, since their
     output formats differ or there is no expiration date in the
     whois output.
   * check_zone_auth (1.13): plugin to ensure that the authoritative nameservers
     for a given zone remain in sync.
   * check_zone_rrsig_expiration (1.10): plugin to check for expiration of
     signatures in dnssec-enabled zones.

       a kernel upgrade
     * check_soas: check SOA records
     * check_statusfile: deliver the content of a status file
       as check result
   * extras (1): various scripts and extras
     Not a plugin, but a collection of various useful
     event/obsession handlers and similar scripts.
 .
 Some scripts and binaries need more packages installed to work, which is
 implemented as recommends.
